To change the color of even <tr> elements in a <table> using jQuery, you can use the :even selector to target those elements and then apply CSS styling to change their color. Here's how you can achieve that:

HTML:

html
Copy code
<table id="myTable">
  <tr><td>Row 1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Row 2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Row 3</td></tr>
  <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
</table>
jQuery:

javascript
Copy code
$(document).ready(function() {
  // Select even <tr> elements inside the table with ID "myTable" and change their background color
  $('#myTable tr:even').css('background-color', 'lightgray');
});
In this example:

We use $(document).ready() to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing the jQuery code.
$('#myTable tr:even') selects all even <tr> elements within the table with the ID "myTable".
.css('background-color', 'lightgray') applies the CSS style to change the background color of the selected <tr> elements to "lightgray".
Adjust the CSS styling as needed to change the color to your desired value. This method will dynamically apply the styling to even <tr> elements whenever the page is loaded or when new rows are added dynamically.
