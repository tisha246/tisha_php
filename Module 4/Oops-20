To build a full-fledged hotel room booking system that allows users to book rooms by three different methods (searching for available rooms, selecting from a list, or specifying preferences), we need to consider various aspects including user interface, database management, user authentication, room availability, and booking management. Below, I'll outline a basic architecture and some key features for each component:

User Interface:
Homepage: Displays information about the hotel and options to search for available rooms or make a booking.
Search Page: Allows users to search for available rooms by specifying check-in/out dates, number of guests, and room preferences.
Room Listing Page: Displays a list of available rooms based on search criteria. Users can view room details and choose a room for booking.
Booking Form: Enables users to fill in their details and confirm the booking.
Database Management:
Database Schema: Tables for storing information such as rooms, bookings, users, and room availability.
Queries: SQL queries to retrieve available rooms, insert new bookings, update room availability, etc.
User Authentication:
User Registration: Allows new users to create an account by providing necessary details.
Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password.
Session Management: Tracks user sessions to maintain login status and access control.
Room Availability:
Availability Check: Checks room availability based on check-in/out dates, number of guests, and room preferences.
Update Availability: Updates room availability status after each booking.
Booking Management:
Booking Confirmation: Confirms booking details and provides a booking reference.
Cancellation: Allows users to cancel bookings within a certain time frame.
View Booking History: Registered users can view their past and upcoming bookings.
Implementation:
Use a web development framework such as Laravel or Symfony for PHP to handle routing, database operations, and authentication.
Implement frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction and dynamic content.
Use a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store hotel and user data.
Implement RESTful APIs for communication between frontend and backend components.
Secure sensitive data and user authentication using encryption and secure protocols.
Considerations:
Ensure the system is scalable and can handle a large number of concurrent users.
Implement data validation and error handling to prevent security vulnerabilities and user errors.
Comply with data protection regulations such as GDPR to protect user privacy.
Test the system thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues before deployment.
Building a complete hotel room booking system is a complex task that requires careful planning, development, and testing. The above outline provides a basic framework to get started, but you may need to customize and expand it based on specific requirements and features of your application.
