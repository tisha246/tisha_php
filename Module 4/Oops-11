If a constructor is defined as private or protected, it restricts the access to that constructor from outside the class. Here's what happens in each case:

Private Constructor:

A private constructor means that the class cannot be instantiated from outside the class itself.
This is often used in classes that are not meant to be instantiated, perhaps because they contain only static methods or serve as containers for other static members.
It can also be used in Singleton design pattern implementations, where the class controls its own instantiation to ensure only one instance is created.
Protected Constructor:

A protected constructor allows only derived classes to access the constructor.
This is useful when you want to prevent instantiation of the base class by external code but still allow derived classes to call the constructor.
It's commonly used in inheritance scenarios where you want to enforce certain initialization logic in the base class, but you want to control which derived classes can be instantiated.
In summary, defining a constructor as private or protected controls the visibility and accessibility of the constructor, which impacts how the class can be instantiated and used by other parts of the program.
