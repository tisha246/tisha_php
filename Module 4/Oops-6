Abstract classes and interfaces are both mechanisms for achieving abstraction and defining contracts in object-oriented programming, but they have some key differences:

Definition:

Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods. It can also contain fields, constructors, and non-abstract methods. Abstract classes can provide a partial implementation of a class, with some methods left to be implemented by subclasses.
Interface: An interface is a reference type similar to a class but contains only method signatures, properties, events, and indexers without implementation. It defines a contract for behavior that implementing classes must adhere to. Interfaces do not contain any implementation details; they only declare the methods that implementing classes must provide.
Instantiation:

Abstract Class: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They can only be used as base classes for other classes (subclasses). Subclasses must provide implementations for all abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
Interface: Interfaces cannot be instantiated at all. They are implemented by classes, and any class implementing an interface must provide implementations for all methods declared in that interface.
Inheritance:

Abstract Class: A class can inherit from only one abstract class (single inheritance). Abstract classes can have constructors and fields, and they can implement methods with partial or full implementation, which subclasses inherit.
Interface: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to fulfill the contracts defined by those interfaces. Interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance-like behavior in languages that do not support multiple class inheritance.
Implementation:

Abstract Class: Abstract classes can provide method implementations, including both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods. Subclasses can choose to override these methods or inherit the implementations.
Interface: Interfaces do not provide any method implementations; they only declare method signatures. Classes implementing an interface must provide implementations for all methods declared in the interface.
Usage:

Abstract Class: Abstract classes are typically used when you have a common base implementation for a group of related classes. They provide a way to define common behavior while allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.
Interface: Interfaces are used to define contracts for behavior without providing any implementation. They enable loose coupling and polymorphism by allowing objects to be treated based on their interfaces rather than their concrete types.
In summary, abstract classes provide a way to define a common base implementation with some methods left unimplemented, while interfaces define contracts for behavior that classes must implement. Abstract classes support single inheritance and can have both abstract and concrete methods, while interfaces support multiple inheritance-like behavior and only contain method signatures. Both abstract classes and interfaces are essential tools for achieving abstraction and designing flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems.
