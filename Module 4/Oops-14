Certainly! Object iteration in PHP can be achieved using the foreach loop. Here's an example PHP script demonstrating object iteration:

php
Copy code
<?php

// Define a class
class MyClass {
    public $name;
    public $age;

    public function __construct($name, $age) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
}

// Create objects of MyClass
$obj1 = new MyClass("John", 30);
$obj2 = new MyClass("Alice", 25);
$obj3 = new MyClass("Bob", 35);

// Create an array of objects
$objects = [$obj1, $obj2, $obj3];

// Iterate over each object
foreach ($objects as $object) {
    // Access object properties
    echo "Name: " . $object->name . ", Age: " . $object->age . "\n";
}

?>
In this script:

We define a class MyClass with two public properties: $name and $age.
We create three objects of MyClass: $obj1, $obj2, and $obj3.
We store these objects in an array called $objects.
We use a foreach loop to iterate over each object in the $objects array.
Within the loop, we access the properties of each object using the arrow operator (->) and print them.
