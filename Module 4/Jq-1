jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies tasks like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) interactions for web development. jQuery makes it easier to write JavaScript code by providing a simple and concise syntax, as well as cross-browser compatibility, which helps ensure that code behaves consistently across different web browsers. It became immensely popular in the early 2010s due to its ease of use and extensive community support. However, with the advancement of modern JavaScript and browser capabilities, its usage has declined in favor of native JavaScript methods and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. Nonetheless, many existing websites still rely on jQuery, and it remains a valuable tool for certain projects.
