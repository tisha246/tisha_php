JavaScript and jQuery are related but different in several key aspects:

Core Functionality: JavaScript is a programming language that is executed by web browsers to make web pages interactive. It's a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, from simple DOM manipulation to complex web applications. jQuery, on the other hand, is a library written in JavaScript. It provides a simplified way to accomplish common tasks, such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and Ajax requests, by abstracting away many of the complexities of raw JavaScript code.

Syntax: JavaScript syntax is based on the ECMAScript standard and is native to web browsers. It uses standard programming constructs such as variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming principles. jQuery, being a library, introduces its own syntax and methods that developers can use to achieve various tasks more easily. It typically involves selecting elements using CSS-style selectors and applying methods to manipulate those elements.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript code needs to be written with consideration for cross-browser compatibility, as different browsers may interpret JavaScript code slightly differently. jQuery abstracts away many of these differences, providing a consistent interface that works across various browsers, thereby simplifying the development process.

Learning Curve: JavaScript requires a deeper understanding of programming concepts and language features. It can be more challenging for beginners due to its complexity and the need to understand fundamental programming concepts. jQuery, on the other hand, provides a more straightforward and concise syntax, making it easier for beginners to get started with web development.

Usage: While JavaScript is a core technology for web development and is used extensively in both client-side and server-side applications, jQuery is often used as a supplementary tool to simplify common tasks in client-side web development. With the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, the usage of jQuery has declined in favor of more modern and efficient solutions.

In summary, JavaScript is the underlying programming language used for web development, while jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies common tasks and provides cross-browser compatibility. They serve different purposes and can be used together or independently depending on the needs of a project.
