
Creating a hotel room booking system can be quite extensive, but I'll outline a basic structure that allows users to book rooms in three different ways: by searching for available rooms, by selecting from a list of available rooms, or by specifying their preferences and letting the system suggest available rooms. Below is a simple implementation in PHP:

php
Copy code
<?php

class Room {
    public $number;
    public $type;
    public $status;

    public function __construct($number, $type) {
        $this->number = $number;
        $this->type = $type;
        $this->status = 'Available'; // Default status
    }
}

class Hotel {
    public $rooms = [];

    public function __construct($numRooms) {
        // Initialize rooms
        for ($i = 1; $i <= $numRooms; $i++) {
            $this->rooms[] = new Room($i, 'Standard');
        }
    }

    public function searchAvailableRooms() {
        $availableRooms = [];
        foreach ($this->rooms as $room) {
            if ($room->status === 'Available') {
                $availableRooms[] = $room;
            }
        }
        return $availableRooms;
    }

    public function bookRoom($roomNumber) {
        foreach ($this->rooms as $room) {
            if ($room->number == $roomNumber) {
                if ($room->status === 'Available') {
                    $room->status = 'Booked';
                    return "Room {$roomNumber} booked successfully.";
                } else {
                    return "Room {$roomNumber} is not available.";
                }
            }
        }
        return "Room {$roomNumber} not found.";
    }
}

// Usage
$hotel = new Hotel(10); // Create a hotel with 10 rooms

// Method 1: Search for available rooms
$availableRooms = $hotel->searchAvailableRooms();
echo "Available Rooms:\n";
foreach ($availableRooms as $room) {
    echo "Room {$room->number} ({$room->type})\n";
}

// Method 2: Book a specific room
echo $hotel->bookRoom(3) . "\n"; // Book room 3
